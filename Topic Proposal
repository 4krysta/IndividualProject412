Fitness Related Web Based Program
Proposal (What is it?): 
In today’s world most of what we revolve around is food oriented. I am looking to create a program that has a mixture of a few different key aspects of life that will make it easier on all the everyday people to create a better lifestyle for themselves. When I say “everyday people” I mean those that don’t feel up to cooking some night and just want to order out, or those that need a little more motivation to work out.
Who will be using it:
This program is open to all users over the age of 16. This will be able to have their fitness goals more specified to them. 
Why is it needed:
Most people want to get in shape but don’t have the energy/motivation to do so. If there is a program that will basically be able to pick out everything they need then there is only one thing stopping them. That would be themselves. If we have a lazy day and don’t want to cook and would rather order out, then we can easily go to this program and find healthy alternatives. 

Aspects:
-	Find healthy food in the local area (eating out) 
o	Enter information:
	What you are in the mood for
	Your location
	Diet questions
-	Create healthy recipes from what you have at home
o	Enter information:
	What food you have at home
	Breakfast/lunch/dinner
-	Track weight/height/age and formulate workout plans to get to specific goal
o	Enter information:
	Age/Height/Weight
	How much you wish to gain/lost
-	Track food/caloric intake
o	Enter food you ate that day
